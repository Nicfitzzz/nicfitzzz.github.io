				<h1>Responsive Design</h1>
				<p class="intro">I surf the web on my phone, my tablet, my laptop, and my 27" monitor. I know I'm not alone, so I venture to make every website I make provide an optimal experience for all its viewers... regardless of their preferred device.</p>
				<a href="http://arendainfinancial.com" target="blank"><img class="foliopics" src="/images/afportfolio.jpg" alt="Arendain Financial website image"/></a>
				<p class="desc">My client, Joel, from Arendain Financial wanted a basic site that looked professional and modern. He needed a page that provided information for potential clients, while still being useful for current clients. Together we collaborated about design, copy, his needs, and how we could meet them.<br>
				<br>We decided the main goals were for contact information and forms, as well providing clients with a calendar for them to view and make appointments.<br>
				<br>The site is live and finished... for now. Talking in person, over the phone, through email and texts, we were able to create something great. Take a look!<br>
				<br>Even though the project is done for now, Joel and I have already been talking about taking the the page to the next level. Working together on projects, and finding ways to enhance the usability of my clients websites, while keeping them beautiful, is what I love to do.</p>
				<img class="foliopics" src="/images/jtripportfolio.jpg" alt="Japan Trip website image"/>
				<p class="desc">This page is in the process of being created to share the experience of Cupertino High School students and their trip to Japan in 2010.<br>
				<br>The goal is for it to display the experience of the participants, but to also provide information for future students, parents, schools, and the community, to promote future support.<br>
				<br>have been on other trip besides 2010, but that was the year I took the most pictures. I love to use my own pictures when creating websites, as it provides me more control, I get the shots I need, and don't have to pay for stock images.</p>

				<p>Developing and designing things on the web is his passion. Striving to create spaces that exhibit beautiful imagery, engaging content, and a useable interface is his goal. Using HTML, CSS, JQuery, JavaScript, and a pinch of PHP he writes and maintains clean code. Perpetually educating himself on the latest trends and techniques, he creates sites that are responsive and 'future proof'.</p>
				<br>
				<p>When he's not busy learning, designing, or coding, (which is rare) you may find him playing basketball or volleyball, riding his bike in the mountains or on the street, making beautiful landscape photography, traveling, or spending quality time with his family.<p>
				<p>Yes, this is Neil, he keeps busy.</p>
