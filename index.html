								<li><strong>What is it:</strong> This is the 3rd iteration of my portfolio website. I am constantly learning new things and always find ways to improve my portfolio.</li>
								<li><strong>Accomplishments:</strong> CSS shadows, jquery selectors, .slideToggle, too many to list.</li>
								<li><strong>What I Learned:</strong> Again too many to list, but I'm learning that I will never stop learning, because there is so much more to learn.</li>

								<li><strong>What is it:</strong> This is another side project I'm working on for the Japanese language students at Cupertino High School. Every couple years the Japanese teacher at CHS takes a group of students to Japan. The purpose of the website is being created to share the experience of the travelers as well show others what the trip is about and how empowering it is for the students</li>
								<li><strong>Accomplishment:</strong> Used jquery and CSS to create a random color change on the borders of the images of the students at a set interval. <a href="http://projects.neilsalazar.com/japan-trip-2010.html#travelers">Check it out!</a></li>
								<li><strong>What I Learned:</strong> That I can use both javascript and jquery to accomplish a goal. </li>

								<li><strong>What is it:</strong> It came up that my tax accountant wanted some revamping of his website. This would be my first website that I've built in years. The goal was to create a place where new clients can learn about Arendain Financial, while also providing his current clients with resources to aid in their tax preparation. Working with Joel, I was able to meet his needs, while also building my portfolio.</li>
								<li><strong>Accomplishment:</strong> One of the first sites I've built. Biggest accomplishments were creating a form that emailed Joel the responses, as well creating a 'sticky nav' from scratch with very few lines of code. </li>
								<li><strong>What I Learned:</strong> I learned that it is important to communicate with the client and ensure that everyone is on the same page. I also learned the importance of making professional decisions that are in the best interest of the client as well as being honest about what is possible and what is not. Lastly as this was one of my first pages, learning to use my resources (other developers/designers) has proven to be invaluable.</li>

				<br>
				<p>I thoroughly enjoy developing and designing things on the web. I continually strive to create spaces that exhibit beautiful imagery, engaging content, and a useable interface. Using HTML, CSS, JQuery, JavaScript, and a pinch of PHP I aim to write and maintain clean code. I am perpetually educating myself on the latest trends and techniques, with the goal of creating sites that are elegant, responsive, and as future proof as possible.</p>
				<p>When I'm not busy learning, designing, or coding, (which is rare) you may find me playing basketball or volleyball, riding my bike in the mountains or on the street, taking pictures, traveling, or spending quality time with my family.</p>
				<p>Yes, this is Neil, I try and keep busy.</p>
